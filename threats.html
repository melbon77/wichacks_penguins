            <h1>Threats to Penguins</h1>
            <p> 
            Five species of penguins are endanger at the moment, but there is a real risk for the others.
            The main issues?
            <br>
            -Climate climate(pollution)
            <br>
            -Excessive fishing
            -Loss of Habitat
            -Oil Spills
            -Contamination

                <h3>1. Climate Change</h3>
                <p>This may be an obvious one. However, what you do to the Earth not only affects you, 
                    but the wildlife around you. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>2. Excessive Fishing</h3>
                <p>Penguins have a certain specific fish that may go towards. 
                    This also can decrease the amount of food available for the penguins. 
                    They may starve themselves to death while looking for the food that isn't available.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>3. Loss of Habitat</h3>
                <p>Humans love their land. Taking land that is vital for penguins survival has caused a problem.
                    They typically look for places that are not a danger from other animals. 
                    Also, feeding the animals human food is dangerous as it can affect their natural hunting abilities.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>4. Oil Spills</h3>
                <p>This has become a problem with penguins as well as other aquatic animals. It affects their swimming abilities
                    and it also clings to their feathers and their skin. They become succeptible to the effects of freezing water
                    with the oil. The oil is also very harmful to their internal organs.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>5. Contamination</h3>
                <p>All the plastic we use has to go somewhere. Plastic waste, chemicals and trash in the ocean is a life-threatening problem.
                    Penguins often mistake these things as food and that can lead to life-threatening problems. The chemicals can
                    also cause reproductive problems and death among some penguins.
