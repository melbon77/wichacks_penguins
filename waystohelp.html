        <p> We as a collective have a role in society to help the penguins. </p>

            <h3>Use less plastic</h3>
            <p>As many of you know, only about 9% of the plastic we use is actually recyled. 
                So if you plan to use plastic, please recycle. It all lands in landfills, which end up in the oceans.
            </p>

            <h3>Over Fishing is a big problem</h3>
            <p>
            Over fishing depletes the krill and other small fish populations, which penguins eat and need to survive.
            If you know of any companies fishing in an area that is close to penguins, please remind them of this issue!

            <h3>Educate yourself</h3>
            <p>
                The more you understand about penguins, the more you can help!

            <h3>Oil Spills</h3>
