            <h3>1. Penguins don't have teeth.</h3>
            <p>Instead, these birds use their beak to grab their food. 
                To help, they also have spines on their tongue and the top of their beak!</p>
        </div>
       
        <div>
            <h3>2. Fish makes up the majority of their diet.</h3>
            <p>Penguins also eat krill, shrimp, and crabs. Excessive fishing can be extremely dangerous for them. 
                Many of them choose a specific type of fish and when the fish is no longer available 
                or very small they starve themselves.</p>

            <h3>3. Penguins lose their feathers once a year!</h3>
            <p>
                A new waterproof coat grows, but until it fully grows, they are not allowed in the water. 
                This process can take up to a few weeks at times. Most lose about half their body weight during this period of time.

            <h3>4. A penguin's body temperature is 100 degrees Farenheit!</h3>
            <p>
               This high temperature allows penguins to live in colder temperatures and survive. 
               Human body temperature is 97.9 to 99 degrees Farenheit for comparison.

            <p>
                Most penguins can swim 5-6 mph, some with 15 mph bursts! Walking is about 1.7 to 2.4 mph for them. 
                The fastest human ran about 24.81 mph for a 100 meters!
